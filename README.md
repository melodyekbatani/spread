## Context  
This was our second coding project for Type and Interaction using HTML and CSS and our first time pair programming! The project was based on the reading What Design Can’t Do — Graphic Design between Automation, Relativism, Élite and Cognitariat by Silvio Lorusso, which can be found here: https://networkcultures.org/entreprecariat/what-design-cant-do/
The reading speaks to the transformation of graphic design (and web design) due to the popularization of templates, automation and increase of gig work in design. 

In understanding this reading, we decided to break the notion of templated design standard and introduce mechanical but slightly destabilized grids. The irregularity of diagonals were a direct response to relativism in contemporary design which Lorusso discussed in the reading. We paired this with expressive type moments and visual hierarchy throughout the reading experience. 
Finally, we experimented with the idea of friction throughout the various breakpoints. We began by creating a strong mobile experience and echoing the design language with the constraints of web and print. 
In doing so, we used used various elements within the HTML and CSS to give both semantic and visual definition. Another key component of this study was to create responsive design, 

## Systems
Throughout this process, we introduced key systems for both creating responsive design and pair programming. We began by critically analysing the reading and picking key elements we wanted to integrate in the design of the webpage. Through this exercise, we were able to begin adding meaning to the semantic structure, breaking down each section of the reading as distinct parts of a whole. Once we had established a strong hierarchy, we began experimenting with typography and applied a root size to the base paragraph, optimized for readability across various breakpoints. 
We also better understand pair programming as an exercise of collaboration and working with restraint, it was a step away from the simultaneous multi cursor experience we are familiar with, through working with design software and was interesting to see how programming is done when one person is in the driver’s seat at any given time. 

## Experiments
We developed systems and grids to follow within the design but also found moments to steer away from those and into an anti-templated design. We followed the principles of Bauhaus and the idea of fragmentation within the Dada art movement to inform the gestural patterns of the reading. 
We treated the navigation as an anchor and each title as its own section within the design. We also added a bookend with the footer navigation, matching the style of the header.

## Results
We learnt a lot from working together on this project together. It was interesting to build upon our skills and work collaboratively in both the design and code.
